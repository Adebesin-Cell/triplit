# Variables

Variables in Triplit allow you to pass in preset values into queries. They consist of a scope (to prevent collisions) and a dot (`.`) separated path to reference data in the variable.

### Global variables

Global variables are prefixed with the `global` scope and are accessible to all queries in the database. They are defined in the DB constructor or via the `updateGlobalVariables` method. For example:

```typescript
const db = new DB({ variables: { name: 'Philip J. Fry' } });
const query = db.query('employees').where('name', '=', '$global.name'); // resolves to 'Philip J. Fry'

db.updateGlobalVariables({ name: 'Turanga Leela' });
const query = db.query('employees').where('name', '=', '$global.name'); // resolves to 'Turanga Leela'
```

### Session variables

Session variables are prefixed with the `session` scope and are accessible to all queries in that database session. They are defined with the `withSessionVars` method. For example:

```typescript
const db = new DB();
const sessionDB = db.withSessionVars({ name: 'Philip J. Fry' });
const query = db.query('employees').where('name', '=', '$session.name'); // resolves to 'Philip J. Fry'
```

### Query variables

Query variables are prefixed with the `query` scope and are accessible just to the query they are defined on. They are defined with the `variables` method in the query builder. For example:

```typescript
const baseQuery = client.query('employees').where([
  ['team', '=', 'Delivery Crew'],
  ['name', '=', '$query.name'],
]);
const fryQuery = baseQuery.variables({ name: 'Philip J. Fry' });
const leelaQuery = baseQuery.variables({ name: 'Turanga Leela' });
```

This can help prevent writing the same query multiple times with different values.

### Expected variables

Certain variables are used internally by Triplit to aid with authorization and other features. These include:

- `$session.SESSION_USER_ID`
