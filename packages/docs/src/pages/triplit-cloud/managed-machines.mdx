# Managed machines

Triplit Cloud offers managed machines for hosting your Triplit server. Managed machines are a great way to get started with Triplit, as they require no setup or maintenance on your part. We handle all the server management, so you can focus on building your app.

## Creating a managed machine

Once you've [created a project](/triplit-cloud), you'll be presented with a choice of deployment options under the **Triplit Cloud** tab:

  width={'100%'}
  style={{ borderRadius: 16, marginTop: 32 }}
/>

Once you've chosen a deployment machine configuration and region, click the **Deploy** button. This will bring you to a checkout page, where you can review your order and enter your payment details.

## Viewing your machine

Once your machine is deployed, you can view its status on the **Overview** tab of your project dashboard. Here you'll see information about your machine, including its region, storage and status.

/>

## Connecting to your machine

To connect your Triplit client to your managed machine, you'll need to update your `.env` file with the machine's URL and API key. You can find these details on the **Overview** tab of your project dashboard.
