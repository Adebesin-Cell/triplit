# Triplit Cloud

Triplit Cloud is a service for managing your Triplit projects. It's free for individuals to use, and integrates with your Triplit server, whether it's managed by us or self-hosted. When you integrate with Triplit Cloud you get access to a range of features, including:

- **The Triplit Console**: A graphical interface for managing your data and schema.
- **Authorization**: Configure access to your server without needing to modify your server's code.

## Creating a project

To create a project:

- [Sign-in or sign-up for a Triplit account](https://triplit.dev/dashboard)
- Click the **Create Project** button
- Provide a name for your project. This will act as a friendly alias for your project throughout the dashboard.

Once you've created a project, you'll be taken to the deployment page. Here you can choose to deploy a managed Triplit Cloud instance, or connect your project to an existing instance.
