# Self-hosted deployments

Triplit Cloud is fully compatible with self-hosted Triplit servers. This means you can deploy your own Triplit server and connect it to the Triplit Cloud dashboard, and reap the benefits of easier server management and use of the Triplit Console.

## Deploying a self-hosted machine

You have two options for deploying a self-hosted machine:

- **Railway**: One-click-deply a Triplit server using Railway. This is the easiest way to get started with a self-hosted machine.
- **Docker**: Deploy a Triplit server using Docker. [Read our self-hosting guide for more information](/self-hosting).

We plan on adding many more one-click-deploy options in the future, so stay tuned!

Once you've [created a project](/triplit-cloud), you'll be presented with some instructions under the **Self Host** tab:

<Image
  src={selfHosting}
  alt="Self hosting instructions"
  width={'100%'}
  style={{ borderRadius: 16, marginTop: 32 }}
/>

Once you have a Triplit server running and [properly configured](#configuration), enter its hostname into the form and click **Connect**.

### Configuration

If you're not using one of the one-click deploy options, you'll need to configure your server to accept requests from the Triplit Dashboard.

- **`PROJECT_ID`**: The unique identifier for your project. You can find this on the deploy instructions screen pictured [above](#deploying-a-self-hosted-machine). Once you're past the creation step, you can find the Project Id in the Triplit Dashboard under your project's settings.

- **`JWT_SECRET`**: The secret used to sign and verify JWT tokens. To use the Triplit Dashboard, set this to the Triplit public key. If you're deploying with Railway, this is configured for you.

```

- Other secrets: If you are **not** using a one-click deployment option, like Railway, there are other secrets you may need to configure, including `LOCAL_DATABASE_URL`, `EXTERNAL_JWT_SECRET` and `CLAIMS_PATH`. You can read more about them in the [self-hosting guide](/self-hosting).

## Connecting your app to your self-hosted machine

The beauty of using a self-hosted server with the Triplit dashboard is that:

- It will mint API keys for you (and let you rotate them)
- You can authorize with external tokens with the server without needing to modify your server's code
- you can manage your data and schema with the Triplit Console

To enable these benefits, your app will connect to a `https://<project-id>.triplit.io` URL. This will route your requests to your self-hosted server.

Copy the secrets from the **Overview** tab (pictured below) into your app's `.env` file.
